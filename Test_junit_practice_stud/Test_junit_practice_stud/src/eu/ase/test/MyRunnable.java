/* 
 *  Implement the public class MyRunnable which implements Runnable interface
 *  The class contains the following private fields:
 *  vector of type Juice[] // classic array of juices
 *  sumMl of type float // the sum of the ml quantities
 *  startPos of type int //the start position in the vector
 *  endPos of type int //the end position in the vector
 *  
 *  Implement the public constructor with 3 parameters:
 *  "data" of type vector of Objects, "startPos" of type int, "endPos" of type int
 *  each element from the array of the class is reference to an object from the data array
 *  
 *  Override the run() method to be called in multi-threading environment for calculating the sum of ml fields from the "vector" array
 *  between "startPos" and "endPos" positions and provide public method getSumMl() which is returning the float "sumMl"
